# MatchingEngine

A high-performance order matching engine implementation in C# for trading systems. This engine implements price-time priority matching similar to what is used in stock exchanges and cryptocurrency trading platforms.

## 🚀 Features

- **High-Performance Order Matching**: O(log n) time complexity for order operations using indexed heaps
- **Price-Time Priority**: Orders matched based on best price first, then by time of arrival
- **Advanced Order Conditions**:
  - **FOK (Fill Or Kill)**: Order must be completely filled immediately or cancelled
  - **IOC (Immediate Or Cancel)**: Fill as much as possible immediately, cancel the rest
  - **BOC (Book Or Cancel)**: Order must not match immediately or it's cancelled
- **Fee Calculation**: Separate maker and taker fee support
- **Market Depth Tracking**: Real-time order book depth monitoring
- **Self-Match Prevention**: Configurable actions to prevent self-trading
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Custom indexed heap implementation for optimal performance

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. MatchingEngine (`OptimizeMatchingEngine`)
The main engine that orchestrates order matching operations:
- Accepts and validates incoming orders
- Executes order matching logic
- Handles order cancellations
- Calculates fees for matched trades
- Validates order conditions (FOK, IOC, BOC)

**Key Methods:**
- `AddOrder(Ordering order, long timestamp, bool isOrderTriggered)` - Add a new order to the book
- `CancelOrder(Guid id)` - Cancel an existing order
- `TryMatchOrder(Ordering incomingOrder)` - Attempt to match an order against the book

#### 2. OrderBook
Manages the order book with bid and ask sides:
- Uses **indexed heaps** for O(log n) operations
- Maintains price levels with linked lists of orders (price-time priority)
- Provides fast access to best bid/ask prices
- Supports efficient order insertion, removal, and matching

**Key Features:**
- Max heap for bids (highest price first)
- Min heap for asks (lowest price first)
- Dictionary-based price level tracking
- Cached sorted prices for efficient iteration
- O(1) best price lookup
- O(log n) order insertion/removal

#### 3. IndexedHeap
A custom heap implementation that supports:
- O(1) peek operation
- O(log n) insert operation
- O(log n) extract operation
- O(log n) remove by value operation (via index map)
- Configurable as min-heap or max-heap

## 📊 Order Lifecycle

```
Prepared → Listed → [Matched] → Filled/Cancelled/Rejected
                         ↓
                    Reduced (partial fill)
```

### Order Statuses

- **Undefined** - Initial state
- **Prepared** - Order created but not yet submitted
- **Listed** - Order accepted and added to the book
- **Matched** - Order partially or fully matched
- **Filled** - Order completely filled
- **Cancelled** - Order cancelled by user or system
- **Rejected** - Order rejected due to invalid conditions
- **Reduced** - Order partially filled and reduced
- **Triggered** - Stop order triggered
- **Expired** - Order expired (time-based)

## 🔧 Order Conditions

### FOK (Fill Or Kill)
- Order must be **completely filled immediately**
- If not enough liquidity, the entire order is **cancelled**
- Cannot be a stop order
- Use case: Large orders that need full execution or none

### IOC (Immediate Or Cancel)
- Fill as much as possible **immediately**
- Any unfilled portion is **cancelled**
- Allows partial fills
- Use case: Orders that need immediate execution with no book presence

### BOC (Book Or Cancel)
- Order must **NOT match immediately**
- If it would match, the order is **cancelled**
- Ensures order is added to the book as a maker
- Use case: Market makers who want to provide liquidity only

## 💡 Usage Example

```csharp
// Create handlers for match events, depth changes, and fees
IMatchHandler matchHandler = new MyMatchHandler();
IDepthHandler depthHandler = new MyDepthHandler();
IFeeProvider feeProvider = new MyFeeProvider();

// Initialize the matching engine
var engine = new MatchingEngine(
    matchHandler: matchHandler,
    depther: depthHandler,
    feeProvider: feeProvider,
    stepSize: 0.01m,          // Minimum price increment
    pricePrecision: 2         // Decimal places for prices
);

// Create and submit a buy order
var buyOrder = new Ordering
{
    OrdId = Guid.NewGuid(),
    IsBuy = true,
    Price = 100.50m,
    Volume = 10m,
    User = "user123",
    FeeId = 1,
    Condition = OrderCondition.None,
    Timestamp = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds()
};

// Add order to the matching engine
var result = engine.AddOrder(buyOrder, buyOrder.Timestamp);

// Handle the result
switch (result)
{
    case MatchState.OrderAccepted:
        Console.WriteLine("Order accepted and processed");
        break;
    case MatchState.FOKCannotFill:
        Console.WriteLine("Fill-or-kill order could not be filled");
        break;
    case MatchState.BOCCannotBook:
        Console.WriteLine("Book-or-cancel order would match immediately");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine($"Order result: {result}");
        break;
}

// Cancel an order
var cancelResult = engine.CancelOrder(buyOrder.OrdId);
```

## 🎯 Matching Algorithm

The engine uses **price-time priority** matching:

1. **Best Price First**: Orders with better prices are matched first
   - For buy orders: highest bid price
   - For sell orders: lowest ask price

2. **Time Priority**: Among orders at the same price, earlier orders are matched first (FIFO)

3. **Matching Process**:
   ```
   1. New order arrives
   2. Check if it can match with best opposite side order
   3. If prices cross:
      - Calculate match volume (minimum of both orders)
      - Execute match at resting order's price
      - Calculate fees for both sides
      - Update order volumes
      - Remove filled orders from book
      - Notify handlers
   4. Repeat until no more matches possible
   5. If order has remaining volume, add to book
   ```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Time Complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Add Order | O(log n) | Insert into heap and price level |
| Cancel Order | O(log n) | Remove from heap and price level |
| Get Best Price | O(1) | Peek heap top |
| Match Order | O(k log n) | k matches, each O(log n) |
| Find Order | O(1) | Dictionary lookup |

Where:
- `n` = number of price levels
- `k` = number of matches for an order

## 🔌 Interfaces

### IMatchHandler
Handles match-related events:
- `OnAccept(Ordering order)` - Order accepted
- `OnCancel(Ordering order)` - Order cancelled
- `OnOrderMatch(Matching match)` - Orders matched
- `OnSelfMatch(Matching match)` - Self-match detected
- `OnOrderTriggered(Ordering order)` - Stop order triggered
- `OnDecrement(Ordering order, decimal decrement)` - Order partially filled

### IDepthHandler
Handles order book depth changes:
- `OnDepthChanged(BookInfo book)` - Price level changed
- `OnMarketChanged(MarketInfo market)` - Market statistics changed

### IFeeProvider
Provides fee rates:
- `GetMakerFee(int feeId)` - Get maker fee rate
- `GetTakerFee(int feeId)` - Get taker fee rate

## 🎲 Self-Match Actions

When an order from the same user matches with their existing order:

- **Match** - Allow the self-match (default)
- **Reduce** - Decrease the volume of the existing order
- **Reject** - Cancel the new order if existing order found
- **Replace** - Cancel the existing order

## 📊 Market Information

The engine tracks comprehensive market statistics:
- **Open/Close Prices** - Session prices
- **High/Low Prices** - Price range
- **Total Volume** - Cumulative traded volume
- **Current Price** - Last trade price
- **Price Change Percentage** - Session change

## 🛠️ Technical Details

2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete order flows
3. **Performance Tests**: Load testing with thousands of orders
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty order book
   - Self-matching scenarios
   - FOK/IOC/BOC conditions
   - Partial fills
   - Concurrent order submissions

## 📝 License

This project structure suggests it's a proprietary trading engine implementation.

## 🤝 Contributing

When contributing to this engine, please ensure:
1. Order matching remains deterministic
2. Price-time priority is maintained
3. All order conditions are respected
4. Performance characteristics are preserved
5. Thread safety is considered for concurrent operations

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Thread Safety**: The current implementation is **not thread-safe**. For production use, add proper locking or use concurrent data structures.

2. **Persistence**: Orders are stored in-memory only. Implement database persistence for production systems.

3. **Matching Price**: Uses the **resting order's price** (maker price) for matches, which is standard in most exchanges.

4. **Fee Calculation**:
   - Buyer (taker): Fee on volume
   - Seller (maker): Fee on total cost (volume × price)

5. **Stop Orders**: Framework supports stop orders but implementation requires additional logic.

6. **Dependencies**: Requires external implementations of:
   - `Extension` namespace (likely contains helper extensions)
   - `Data.Models` namespace
   - `MatchEngine.Interfaces` namespace
